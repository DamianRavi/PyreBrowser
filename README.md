## Completely Decentralized Browser
The Pyre Network is a completely decentralized P2P browser that allows you to host and share websites for free with complete ownership of your domain and no DNS fees. You no longer need to pay annual fees and can put the domain on sale for others to buy within their browser! The sites are shared between users using P2P Swarm infrastructure and blockchain technology so you never need to pay for hosting either. Likely if you are using a database then you will need to use a server like AWS or Vultr but we hope to solve this soon with PyreSwarm - a decentralized swarm database that pays you simply for keeping your browser open and sharing data. Manage cross-chain transactions, swaps, emails and subscriptions with PyrePass, an inbuilt wallet that allows for seamless ecommerce across all sites.

## No Hosting Fees, No Servers
Pyre Browser supports all major frameworks and has several templates that can be easily modified. The easiest method to get a site running is as follows:
1. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
2. Run Command: `npx create-react-app ./my-pyre-site`
3. Run Command: `cd ./my-pyre-site`
4. Run Command: `npm run build`
5. Search for the domain you want in the address bar, upload the build folder and then purchase the site. We automatically host new sites for a few weeks for others to seed.

## Perfectly Indexed Sites
PyreSearch pulls all websites from the blockchain and indexes them thoroughly. It uses a completely unbiased search algorithm and has no cencorship or monetary influence. Pyre URLs also allow all UTF-8 characters and so all languages are supported!

## Integrated Crypto ID and Payment system for all sites
PyrePass is a wallet similar to Metamask and has several cool features including cross-chain compatability and integrated staking functionality. We want it to be something similar to a google address with seamless integration for user databases and ecommerce payments. It also acts as a good store of savings as you can quickly stake funds for 14% interest with Polkadot (We will add a few other staking options for a more balanced portfolio later).

## Decentralized Mail System
PyreMail allows you to send mail, airdrops and purchase receipts to various EVM addresses. It charges per mail sent and you can modify the cost of your own mail received. You can essentially get paid for spam and airdrops from other users. If you are an influencer then this also allows for a good method of monetizing interactions with your fanbase.

## Distributed Database
PyreSwarm (WIP) is a decentralized database that shares files between users for sites. The websites pay a fixed subscription to host their files and all seeders gain a share of these fees. It is intended to be a good source of income while your browser is kept open.
